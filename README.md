This program uses OpenAI's Whisper V3 model in order to process the words spoken by the user and deal with them according to the user's wishes. Currently the accepted options are to transcribe the words spoken into a text file created with the date the audio is transcribed, or to feed the user's words into the Ollama API which allows the user to ask the model questions.
